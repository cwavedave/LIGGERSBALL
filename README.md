<h2> About </h2>

Website was designed on an extremely tight turnaround so some features are missing, such as the intended Javascript Gallery. Functionality will likely be included for the next years event promotional run-up

<h2> Tools </h2>
The website was built with React & Tailwind CSS & hosted on AWS Amplify
